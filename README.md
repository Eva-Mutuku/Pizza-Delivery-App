 ## Behavior Driven Development
 1. On the main page, there is a form where you fill in the order details.
 2. After that, one presses the place order button and a summary of order section comes up with the summary of items in the cart. 
 3. Upon confirming, one can press on delivery button to input their contact and location details.
 4. Price changes with delivery.
 5. A pop up confirming the order will come with a thank you message as well.
